**Bring cloud-users closer together.**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/circles/master/screenshots/0.12.0.png)

Circles allows your users to create their own groups of users/colleagues/friends. 
Those groups of users (or circles) can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose 
(files, social feed, status update, messaging, â€¦) through the Circles API

Different types of circles can be created:


- A **Personal Circle** is a list of users known only to the owner.  
This is the right option if you want to do recurrent sharing with the same list of local users.

- A **Public Circle** is an open group visible to anyone willing to join.  
Anyone can see the circle, can join the circle and access the items shared to the circle.
 
- Joining a **Closed Circle** requires an invitation or a confirmation by a moderator.  
Anyone can find and request an invitation to the circle; but only members can see its membership and get access to its shared items.

- A **Secret Circle** is an hidden group that can only be seen by its members or by people knowing the exact name of the circle.  
Non-members won't be able to find your secret circle using the search bar.

`./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 local_is_non_ssl`
